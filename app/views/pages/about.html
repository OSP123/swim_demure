<div class="about">
<p>At NAVA, we recognize that there is a clear need for conservative swimwear in today’s global market. Women today are active and enjoy many water activities that life has to offer. There are, however, no swimwear lines that are dedicated to catering to the needs of woman who choose to dress modestly without compromising style. We feel it is important for these women to participate in fun activities and adventure parks where dress codes are strictly enforced, yet feel comfortable, modest and beautiful while doing so.</p>
​
<p>NAVA Swimwear prides itself on quality, fashionable and conservative swimwear that looks sophisticated as well as being functional. While safety is a focus in our business, we found a way to eliminate compromising issues so that women can enjoy water activities without any distractions.</p>
​
<p>These swimsuits are innovative and have new design elements and features, utilizing top of the line fabrics, trims and current technology. We are focused on promoting unique swimwear products rather than mass merchandising or counterfeits. While remembering that our swimsuits involve a lot of coverage, the featured designers we hire are experienced and understand the importance of fit, forcing them to be careful in choosing the right fabrics so that they remain comfortable. </p>
​
<p>The swimsuits featured on our site are manufactured in the United States of America. We hope to meet all your swimsuit needs!<p>
